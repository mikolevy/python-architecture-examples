# Python Architecture Examples

## Flask Example

An example of using Hexagonal/Clean architecture approach to build rich model in Python in Flask: `fexample` directory

## Django Example

Examples in Django are in `backend` directory.
In `examples` there are packages with:
- transaction script
- anemic model with simple CRUD
- anemic model (base example)
- anemic model with complex logic

Insurances application is an example of rich model (with Hexagonal/Clean Architecture) implementation in Django (using custom ORM <-> Domain Model mappings).

## TODO
- Use other ways of mapping Django ORM <-> Domain Model
- Implement more examples to show usage of other building blocks - cover different approaches and flavours
